# Personal notes

**Starting off with what makes Go, Go**

- Compiles and runs code faster than many interpreted languages
- Writes highly concurrent code
- Runs directly on hardware
- Works on a ton of modern features like packages while also excluding stuff like classes.

> Google developed Go and its standard library as an answer to software problems at Google: multicore processors, networked systems, massive computation clustersâ€”in other words, distributed systems, and at large scale in terms of lines of code, programmers, and machines.
