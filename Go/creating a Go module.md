# Personal notes

This notes section is based off of this tutorial section from the official Go docs: [Tutorial: Create a Go module - The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module)

Two files:
	- A library module that is intended to be imported by other libs/apps.
	- A caller application.
