### This will be a quick guide into how to get this repository working, and how the workflow for it will look like.

**Starting from scratch**
First thing you need to do is press Fork, and fork my repo to your end.

The processes that follow, assume that you have SSH set up. If you don't have it set up, follow [this source for it](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html)

Step 1: Navigate to your folder of choice, and `git clone your-ssh-link-copied-from-clipboard`

	^^ Copy from here (this is an example btw)

Step 2: `cd go-vault`
Step 3: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/TheAntiSnipe/go-vault.git`
